Terrible setup guide - requires Windows and Python
1. Download the .bat and .py file and place in your DOOM Eternal installation folder
2. Download FusionTools 2.4.2 from NexusMods and place in your DOOM Eternal installation folder
3. Create a folder titled 'xmls' in your DOOM Eternal installation folder.
4. Place XML files written to mod HIRC objects into the 'xmls' folder (I still need to writeup a guide on the format of these files - you can't just drag and drop an exported mus.pck xml file)
5. Double click the .bat file, PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION WHEN IT SAYS NOT TO TOUCH YOUR MOUSE AND KEYBOARD UNTIL THE PROCESS IS FINISHED
